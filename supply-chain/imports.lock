All two functions from the public API of this crate use `unsafe` to avoid bound
checks for an array access.  Cross-module analysis shows that the offsets can
be statically proven to be within array bounds.  More details can be found in

This crate does not contain any unsafe code, and does not use any items from
the standard library or other crates, aside from operations backed by
`std::ops`. All paths with array indexing use integer literals for indexes, so
there are no panics due to indexes out of bounds (as rustc would catch an
out-of-bounds literal index). I did not check whether arithmetic overflows
could cause a panic, and I am relying on the Coq code having satisfied the
necessary preconditions to ensure panics due to overflows are unreachable.
