# Tari Bulletproofs+

## Overview

Tari Bulletproofs+ is an implementation of _Bulletproofs+: Shorter Proofs for Privacy-Enhanced Distributed Ledger_ [2], 
which was derived from the original _Bulletproofs: Short Proofs for Confidential Transactions and More_ [1]. The former 
offers a 96 bytes shorter proof size than the latter.

## Comparative performance

As we intend to move from Bulletproofs [1] to Bulletproofs+ [2] in our 
[blockchain poject](https://github.com/tari-project), the natural benchmark comparison is with Dalek's Bulletproofs [4]. 
On average, our proof creation and proof verification are respectively 32% and 4% slower. However, employing batch 
verification, immediate benefits are evident, with gains ranging from 38% to 74% for batch sizes from 2 to 32 proofs. 
Thus, with our current implementation, we could not recreate the experimental results in [2], which claimed 16% 
reduction in prover time. However, our 4% increase in verification time is exactly on par with their 3%.
