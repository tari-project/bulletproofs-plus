# Tari Bulletproofs+

## Overview

Tari Bulletproofs+ (BP+) implements _Bulletproofs+: Shorter Proofs for Privacy-Enhanced Distributed Ledger_ [2],  
derived from the original Bulletproofs (BP) work _Bulletproofs: Short Proofs for Confidential Transactions and More_ 
[1]. The former offers a 96 bytes shorter proof size than the latter.

## Comparative performance

As we intend to move from Bulletproofs [1] to Bulletproofs+ [2] in our 
[blockchain project](https://github.com/tari-project), the natural benchmark comparison is with the experimental results 
in [2] and Dalek's Bulletproofs [4]. Compared with Dalek's Bulletproofs, our average proof creation is 30% slower, 
while verification is on par. Compared with the experimental results in [2], we could not recreate the 16% reduction in 
prover time; however, our 1% increase in verification time is on par with their 3%. Immediate benefits are evident 
when employing batch verification; exponential gains range from 37% to 79% for batch sizes from 2 to 256 proofs.

Extended commitments add virtually no overhead in single or aggregated range proof creation or verification time, 
neither in batched verification time nor when compared to regular Pedersen commitments.

Mask/blinding factor recovery adds moderate (5% for single proof-verification with extension degree zero) to significant 
(22% for 256 single batched proofs verification with extension degree two) overhead to verification performance; 
comparisons below were made without activating the recovery feature. Deactivating proof verification for a 
"mask-recovery-only" mode of operation is possible and omits the expensive multi-exponentiation multiplication, 
resulting in linear performance (as opposed to exponential gains/cost). Batched "mask-recovery-only" is approximately 
10% more costly on average when compared to non-batched recovery. 

**Note:** The test results listed here are relative; the numbers are not absolute. The tests were run on an Intel(R) 
Core(TM) i7-7820HQ CPU laptop without using the `simd_backend` feature.

### Aggregated 64-bit range proof creation

_**Notes:**_
- Median values are used for comparison.
- In the headings and legends:
  - `ed_0` means extension degree zero
  - `ed_1` means extension degree one
  - `ed_2` means extension degree two

### Batched 64-bit single range proof mask recovery

Mask-recovery-only mode is linear and does not benefit from batched operations; batched recovery is suboptimal.
